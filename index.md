## Welcome to Defuddle

Currently just a dummy test page while testing out github pages

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Purpose

This page will become the landing point for articles simplifying complicated subjects

For example: Current pain is setting up github pages with custom sub domains (such as blog.xxx) and https redirects from my custom domain.
With luck you are accessing this page via https://defuddle.me rather than https://defuddle.github.io
